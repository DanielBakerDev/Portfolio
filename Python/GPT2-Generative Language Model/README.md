Summary:
This assignment involves using transformer models for semantic search and language generation. In Part 1, students will experiment with different embedding techniques in an information retrieval context using the sentence-transformers python package. They will be given a tweets-utf-8.json file containing tweets geolocated to London and Ottawa in 2017 and will be required to write functions to read and sort the tweets based on similarity to a query. In Part 2, students will learn about how generative language models, focusing on GPT-2, can be used in practice to generate stories. They will be required to write a script that generates a unique story using a local GPT-2 model. The deliverables for each part include a Python file and a text file for the output.
