Examine the output from both models given our test query, “I am looking for a job.”

1. Identify two differences in the overall results of the two methods and explain why these differences might 
be occurring.
1) Some posts in first query appear to have nothing to do with looking for job while all of 2 do
This difference might be occurring because the first method uses far less processing to understand what the actual meaning of the tweets are compared
to the second method that takes far longer to analyze each tweet and get a realistic meaning.
2) Query 2 appears to have more pictures and hashtags while query 1 has more emojis.
This is an interesting difference which may be caused by either:
a) Differences in the linguistic writing of people using pictures emojis and hashtags (EX: people who use emojis tend to be more descriptive in
their writing)
b) The models give different weights of similarity based on these special characters. The first method has a bias towards emojis and gives them
a significant boost when used in a tweet.
The second model gives a significant bias towards hashtags and pictures. Meaning that tweets that have something to do with our query get an even 
larger boost when a picture or hashtag is used as well.


2. Try out the query in Twitter’s own search on their website. 
(Note you don’t need an account to try it.) 
Do you think Twitter might be using a semantic search technique like the ones you tried? Why or why not?
I don't think so, when doing the twitter search it was first incredibly fast and when doing our searches over less tweets
it takes our program far longer to run. Using any sort of ML NLP model to search through large amounts of data would be
expensive for twitter to run in cost and time. Second the results that come from twitter seem to be matching words/phrases in
the text we are searching rather than for searching for the meaning of the text that we did in our methods. It appears
as if twitter uses a simpler search based on keyword finder.
