Summary:
This program is focused on introducing MongoDB, a widely-used tool for the management and querying of big, unstructured data. It explains how MongoDB uses JSON and related BSON formats for data and provides JavaScript templates for each question. The program contains detailed instructions for installing MongoDB on various systems, including using Docker or Podman on a VM. It also provides information on importing tweet data into MongoDB and using MongoDB queries, aggregation framework, and MapReduce to retrieve information from the tweet data. The program offers six questions to write queries, one question to write a MapReduce function and a query to produce a new collection that contains each hashtag used in the collection of tweets, along with the number of times that hashtag was used.
