The project consists of a C# program that reads noun data from two input files: "NounsData.txt" and "NounsIndex.txt". The data is stored in two dictionaries: nounDataDict and nounIndexDict. The program then prompts the user for a non-zero integer and a file name. It validates the input and reads the specified file to extract a list of words.

Using the list of words and the user-provided integer, the program generates n-grams by concatenating the words with underscores. These n-grams are stored in a list. The program then performs dictionary lookups based on the generated n-grams using the nounIndexDict and nounDataDict dictionaries.

The results of the dictionary lookups are written to an output file named "output.txt". The program iterates over each n-gram, performs the lookups, and writes the n-gram and the associated values to the output file. Multiple dictionary lookups can be performed for a single n-gram, and the values are concatenated with special markers.

Once the process is complete, the program outputs a message indicating that it has finished running. The user can then check the file folders for the generated "output.txt" file.

Overall, this project aims to generate n-grams from an input file, perform dictionary lookups, and output the results to a text file. It demonstrates file handling, dictionary usage, and string manipulation in C#.
