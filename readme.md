### GPT-2-Generative Language Model
This assignment involves using transformer models for semantic search and language generation. In Part 1, students will experiment with different embedding techniques in an information retrieval context using the sentence-transformers python package. They will be given a tweets-utf-8.json file containing tweets geolocated to London and Ottawa in 2017 and will be required to write functions to read and sort the tweets based on similarity to a query. In Part 2, students will learn about how generative language models, focusing on GPT-2, can be used in practice to generate stories. They will be required to write a script that generates a unique story using a local GPT-2 model. The deliverables for each part include a Python file and a text file for the output.
